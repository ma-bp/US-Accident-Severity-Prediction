# US-Accident-Severity-Prediction

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

Overview of the Dataset:

The US Accidents (2016-2021) dataset from 
Kaggle is a nationwide car accident dataset that 
encompasses all 49 states throughout the United 
States. It comprises about 1.5 million 
occurrences of road accidents commencing 
between February 2016 and December 2021.
Data is incessantly accumulated utilising 
numerous data providers including several 
API’s providing stream traffic event data. API’s 
transmits traffic events acquired via variation of 
entities; US and state departments of 
transportation, law enforcement agencies, 
traffic camera and traffic sensor within the 
road-networks.

The dataset consists of different degrees of 
severity which ranges from severity level 1 to 
level 4. 

1. Severity 1 being least impact on traffic 
flow.
2. Severity 4 being the highest impact on 
traffic flow.

Due to the dataset being large, it is segmented into 
5 attributes alongside features.

1. Traffic Attributes (4 features)
2. Time Attributes (3 features)
3. Location Attributes (13 features)
4. Weather Attributes (10 features)
5. POI – Point of Interest Attributes (13 
features)

Explaratory Analysis and Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms on US-Accident-Severity-Prediction dataset.

Algorithms used: 

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Gussian Naive Bayes (Naive Bayes)
6. Bernoulli Naive Bayes (Naive Bayes)
7. Multi-Layer Preceptron

Alongside with the experimentation of optimal values on Hyper-Parameters.
